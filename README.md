# AI Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API

This project implements an AI chatbot using OpenAI's GPT API. The chatbot can generate natural language responses to user inputs and is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. The chatbot can be accessed through a web interface, which is built using the Gradio library.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need to obtain an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage

To run the chatbot, run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the web interface for the chatbot. To use the chatbot, simply type a message into the input box and press "Enter". The chatbot will generate a response and display it in the output box.

## Further Development

This chatbot can be further developed by fine-tuning the GPT model on a specific corpus of text data that is relevant to the desired use case. Additional features can also be added to the chatbot, such as sentiment analysis or speech recognition. Finally, the chatbot can be integrated with other APIs and tools to expand its capabilities and improve the user experience.
